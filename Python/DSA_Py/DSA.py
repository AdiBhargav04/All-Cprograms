# DSA

# What is Data Structures?
# Way to organize data in main memory

# Algorithm:
# Sequence of steps to solve a problem

# Why DSA?
# makes you an efficient S. Dev

# Analysis of Algorithms:
# for solving a problem, there moght be many ways or algos
# so analysis of algo helps to choose the best method to solve the particular problem

# eg 
# find sum of first n natural numbers

# 1. for loop
# for i in range(n+1):
#    sum+=i

# 2. Using formula
# n*(n+1)/2

# 3. nested loop
# for i inn range(n+1):
#   for j in range(1,i+1):
#       sum+=1

# Asymptotic Analysis: 
# A theoritical and mathematical analysis
# With asymptotic analysis we dont even have to implement all solutions
# just by looking at the algo we can tell which one is more efficient theortically

# the aim is to measure the order of growth of the time taken by a prgm/fn in terms of input size
#  i.e. whether the program is growing linearly or quadratically or is it 
# a constant
